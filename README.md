We made Hermes's shoes Talaria for Vritual Reality.<br>
With Talaria, People can see what he didn't see, go anywhere what he didn't go.
We figure out about motion sickness in VR and fix it with talaria.


I want to hide the main technic, so the Fixed OpenVR code wasn't open.<br>
if you want that code, contact me.
